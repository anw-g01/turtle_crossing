# Turtle Crossing

A game where the player controls a turtle character and tries to cross a busy road with moving car obstacles. The game gets progressively more challenging as the player advances through levels.

## Project Files
1. `main.py`: The main game script that runs the game loop and implements the programming logic for the game.
2. `gameplay.py`: Defines the `Game` class that manages game elements and logic.
3. `classes.py`: Contains the `Player`, `Car`, `CarManager`, and `Scoreboard` classes for game objects and interactions.
4. `config.py`: Stores configuration parameters for adjusting screen dimensions, car spawning probability, animation speeds and more.

## How to Play
1. Run the game by executing the `main.py` file.
2. Use keyboard arrow keys to control the player's turtle character.
3. The objective is to reach the top of the screen, crossing the road without getting hit by cars.
4. As you progress through levels, cars move faster, and the game becomes more challenging.
5. If you get hit by a car, the game is over, and your highest level reached is displayed.
